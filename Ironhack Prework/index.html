						<p>I'm <em>Maegan Tomela Burke</em>, a 26-year-old female from <strong>Providence, RI, USA</strong>.  I'm passionate about many things, including, but not limited to music, traveling, yoga, food and peace.  I have many dreams, too many of which to speak on, but of the most important is my goal of traveling all over the world.  I appreciate new cultures and learning about the struggles of peoples all over the globe.</p>
						<p>Here's a list of foreign countries that I have visited and the corresponding year(s) that I visited.</p>

						<h1>My Travel Goals</h1>
						<img src="./South Africa.jpg" />
							<p>Aside from my all-encompassing goal of traveling the world, I have two (kinda 3) specific trips of a lifetime planned for my future self.
								<ol>
									<li>UK to South Africa: pretty straight forward --  I want to travel (in one trip, duh) from the UK and make my way down to South Africa, visiing a bunch of new countries along the way.</li>
									<li>RTW: I want to travel 'Round the World' in one trip -- travel agencies will plan these trips out for you, but considering I want to create my own travel agency (more on that later), I plan on curating my own RTW trip. </li>
									<li>Yoga Teacher Training: this clearly isn't a place, but I aspire to complete my 300 hour yoga teacher certification abroad, preferably in India or Costa Rica. #lifegoals </li>
								</ol>
